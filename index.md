# Origami Repetika's Markdown File 
**11/26/23** This is where I plan to post news about my music project. 
I'm finding that markdown is more convenient than html, and at this time, I plan to use GitHub as my home site since it'll automatically display my markdown meanderings. In music-related news, I've been working on new music lately with renoise, mpc one, guitar, and voice. Planning to have at least one release out sometime next year.
