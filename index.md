# Origami Repetika's Markdown File 
**12/21/23**
On the final lap in the production of my next album. It's tentatively titled **Emerald Circus**. The Emerald part of the title gives a wink to the fun fact that it's already been 20 years since my first Repetika netlabel release... emerald is, in some traditions, the stone of a 20-year anniversary. And the Circus part.. well, to my old ears at least, the album as a whole comes off like a circus of sorts. It has singing songs, instrumentals *(two of them being previously unreleased while hoarding them for years waiting to figure out what to do with them, and one of them being an experimental piece consisting of a 16-minute adaption of Terry Riley's In C paired up with an ominous Shepard Tone:D)* The album even includes a cover of a Neil Young song! I haven't ended up with a collection of music like this one before. It's by far my favorite one yet and I very much look forward to submitting it to *(hint)* the netlabel that published my first ever netlabel release. More info to come soon!

**11/26/23** This is where I plan to post news about my music project. 
I'm finding that markdown is more convenient than html, and at this time, I plan to use GitHub as my home site since it'll automatically display my markdown meanderings. It'll also record all the many edits that I might make too :D In music-related news, I've been working on new music lately with renoise, mpc one, guitar, and voice. Planning to have at least one release out sometime next year.
