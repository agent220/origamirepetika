My new album, [**Emerald Campground**, is now online on Sub65](https://archive.org/details/s65146)! It's the younger sibling of **Emerald Circus**, which should be available soon as it's currently sitting second place in [20kbps.net](https://20kbps.net)'s release queue. 
Emerald Campground is unlike any of my other releases in that the raw vibes of the tracks inspired me to do something different and instead of mixing and EQing the tracks so that they'll all play together in a common bit rate, I went ahead and rendered each song to it's own bitrate in which the music sounds the best. This made postproduction delightfully easy this time. The bitrates fluctuate throughout the span of the nine songs, yet collectively, they present an interesting and enjoyable flow. It's the kind of album that plays super nicely at a comfortable volume through your favorite pair of headphones and also sounds great blasting through speakers too. 
I also cooked up a little music video for one of the tracks, [Conversation Town](https://youtu.be/jhOjQ8nYVIw?si=49kDxjUbguE0htjy).

It's been 20 effin' years since my first netlabel release! [Mini Oubum](https://archive.org/details/20k085), a three track ambient techno EP, was released by [20kbps rec.](https://20kbps.net) on the 5th of May, 2004. I still can't believe that it's been two full decades already. Time is flying by! Hopefully I'll get to squeeze out another 20. Planning to celebrate the occasion with Taco Bell tacos. They're having a special sale (five for $5) as today also happens to be Cinco De Mayo. 

New music should be coming out soon enough. As mentioned in the previous post, Emerald Circus is in netlabel queue and will eventually be online. Also been working on another Emerald release. This one currently has the working title of **Emerald Campground** as so far these songs have campy kind of vibes. Many of them are rough around the edges and seem as though they're screaming at me to stay this way. Hoping to have this out on sub by the end of August.

New year, new update.. Yesterday I sent in Emerald Circus to the netlabel that will eventually be releasing it. *(more details on that, and which netlabel it can be downloaded from, when the time comes)*  I'm super grateful that the second half of 2023 was productive enough to have a full-length album's worth of music. 

In other news, I hope the recent wave of inspiration and motivation continues on through 2024 so that I can hear what I come up with next. I'm thinking that if it does, there'll also be something available sometime this year on sub65. But we'll see.

I cooked up a new profile banner on Logopit for my Twitter. It toots my own horn to 20 years of Origami Repetika. I'll be applying the new banner soon.

Speaking of Twitter, I haven't been on Twitter as much lately. I still regularly update lowdown and sub65 news on those accounts, but I've been taking it easy on my main account as it seemed like the site was getting worse in a lot of ways. It's called "X" now, but to me it'll always be Twitter. I'll still use it from time to time to post major Repetika announcements and any retweets of special interest, but yeah, haven't been as active as before on @origamirepetika.

On the final lap in the production of my next album. It's tentatively titled **Emerald Circus**. The Emerald part of the title gives a wink to the fun fact that it's already been 20 years since my first Repetika netlabel release... emerald is, in some traditions, the stone of a 20-year anniversary. And the Circus part.. well, to my old ears at least, the album as a whole comes off like a circus of sorts. It has a song about a rodeo of leaf blowers, a song about the world's greatest bad poet, two previously unreleased instrumentals that I've been hoarding for years while waiting to figure out what to do with them, an experimental piece consisting of a 16-minute adaption of Terry Riley's In C paired up with an ominous Shepard Tone, a cover of a Neil Young song, and much more! I haven't ended up with a collection of music like this one before. It's by far my favorite one yet and I very much look forward to submitting it to *(hint)* the netlabel that published my first ever netlabel release. More info to come soon!

**11/26/23** This is where I plan to post news about my music project. 
I'm finding that markdown is more convenient than stumbling my way through html, and at this time, I plan to use GitHub as my home site since it'll automatically display my markdown meanderings. The dates of each post in this file are more like *idea markers*, for lack of a better description. I'm not the quickest-witted wordsmith, and too often it takes me a while to nail down certain thoughts. So I could end up making changes/corrections/etc. to previous posts every now and again, but a nice feature of GitHub is that it'll record any edits that I make for anyone that wants to sleuth through all of that.

In music-related news, I've been working on new music lately with renoise, mpc one, guitar, and voice. Planning to have at least one release out sometime next year.
