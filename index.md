# Origami Repetika's Markdown File 
**12/21/23**
On the final lap in the production of my next album. It's tentatively titled **Emerald Circus**. The Emerald part of the title gives a wink to the fun fact that it's already been 20 years since my first Repetika netlabel release... emerald is, in some traditions, the stone of a 20-year anniversary. And the Circus part.. well, to my old ears at least, the album as a whole comes off like a circus of sorts. It has a song about a rodeo of leaf blowers, a song about the world's greatest bad poet, two previously unreleased instrumentals that I've been hoarding for years while waiting to figure out what to do with them, an experimental piece consisting of a 16-minute adaption of Terry Riley's In C paired up with an ominous Shepard Tone, and even a cover of a Neil Young song! I haven't ended up with a collection of music like this one before. It's by far my favorite one yet and I very much look forward to submitting it to *(hint)* the netlabel that published my first ever netlabel release. More info to come soon!

**11/26/23** This is where I plan to post news about my music project. 
I'm finding that markdown is more convenient than stumbling my way through html, and at this time, I plan to use GitHub as my home site since it'll automatically display my markdown meanderings. The dates of each post in this file are more like *idea markers*, for lack of a better description. I'm not a master wordsmith, and too often it takes me a while to nail down certain thoughts. So I'll be making changes every now and again, but a nice feature of GitHub is that it'll record any edits that I make for anyone that wants to sleuth through all of that.

In music-related news, I've been working on new music lately with renoise, mpc one, guitar, and voice. Planning to have at least one release out sometime next year.
