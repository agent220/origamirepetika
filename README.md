I manage a lobit netlabel called [sub65 media](https://bbis.us/~newform/sub65/) 

I also manage an Internet radio program on [Mad Wasp Radio](https://MadWaspRadio.com) called [the lowdown](https://bbis.us/~newform/thelowdown/) which focuses on playing lobit music, but also plays pretty much anything sent in and/or found in the underground netlabel scene.
